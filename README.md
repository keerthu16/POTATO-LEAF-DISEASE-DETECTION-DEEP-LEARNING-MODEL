# POTATO LEAF DISEASE DETECTION DEEP LEARNING MODEL
 
Summary of the Process:
Import Dependencies: Import necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, matplotlib, and others required for building and training the model.

Set Constants: Define constants like batch size, image size, number of channels, and number of epochs.

Load Data: Use tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory to load images from the directory into a TensorFlow dataset.

Visualize Data: Display some sample images from the dataset with their respective class labels.

Split Dataset: Create functions to split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Shuffle, cache, and prefetch the datasets to improve performance.

Data Preprocessing: Define layers for resizing and normalizing images. Apply data augmentation to the training dataset to enhance model performance.

Build Model: Construct a Sequential CNN model. The model includes layers for resizing, normalizing, and multiple convolutional and max pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification.

Compile Model: Configure the model for training by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

Train Model: Train the model on the training dataset while validating it on the validation dataset over multiple epochs.

Evaluate Model: Evaluate the model on the test dataset to check its performance. Achieving high accuracy is an indication of a well-trained model.

Visualize Training Results: Plot the training and validation accuracy and loss to understand the model's learning behavior over epochs.
